# Project Title:

## Implement Logistic Regression for binary classification problem.

* The files "logisticX.csv"and "logisticY.csv" contain the inputs x(i) and outputs y(i) respectively for a binary classification problem, with one training example per row.
* Used Newton method for the optimiztion of the log likelihood function for logistic regression.
* Plot the decision boundary fit by the model showing the boundary seperating the region where h(x) > 0.5 and from where h(x) <= 0.5
